    # Istio tries to inject sidecars into all pods, including those managed by the Prometheus Operator.
    # The prometheus certificate generation pods created are temporary and the sidecar injection tries to continue to run even tho the pod has exited.
    # This causes the intallation to timeout as the sidecar injection tries to inject into pods that are not running.
    # To avoid this, we disable the sidecar injection for the temporary webhook pods created by the Prometheus Operator.
